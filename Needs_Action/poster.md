# 🚀 Draft: LinkedIn Post for Business Leads

"I asked an AI to write my bio and it just said 'Will code for coffee and fewer meetings.' Honestly? Accurate." ☕️💻

In all seriousness, I’ve been diving deep into some incredible **project** builds lately, and my terminal has never looked busier. If your team is looking to scale or needs a **software developer** who speaks fluent 'Bug-Fix' and 'Deadline-Met,' let’s chat!

I’m excited to offer custom development services for anyone looking to turn their "it works on my machine" into "it works for every **client**." 

**The Benefit:** You get clean, scalable code; I get to solve cool puzzles. Everyone wins. 

Got a **sales** lead or a technical challenge that needs a fresh set of eyes? **DM for more!** 📩
